Public Draft Page Preview allows you to share draft posts or pages with anonymous users via a secure, expiring URL, with customizable expiration settings in the WP admin panel.

## Description

Public Draft Page Preview allows you to share a draft of any post or page with anonymous users before it is published. You can set a custom expiration time directly from the WP admin panel, ensuring full control over access duration.

This plugin is perfect for collaborating with external users who donâ€™t have access to your site but need to review content before it goes live. Generate a secure, expiring URL for easy sharing, and manage its availability with a simple checkbox in the post editor.

### Key Features
- Share draft posts and pages with users via a secure URL.
- Set customizable expiration time for preview links (days, hours, and minutes).
- Control the preview feature directly from the WP admin panel.
- Option to disable previews by unchecking the box in the post editor.
- Lightweight and easy to use, with no additional configuration required.
